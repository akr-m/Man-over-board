# Computer Vison & Image Processing: Man over board

"Man overboard‚Äù is a situation where someone from the ship falls out at sea. In such circumstances it is very important to track the person to facilitate the rescue, but it is not always an easy task. Even though the person can be near the rescue boat  with his coloring life jacket on, the movement of the camera, together with the heavy waves and the movement of the person make the task difficult.

The aim of this project is to analyze some of  the problems faced by tracking algorithms, using a test video of a buoy representing a human at sea. The first requirement is the detection of the object, followed by the stabilization of the movements of the camera. The next step is keeping track of the object and estimating its distance from the rescue vessel.
